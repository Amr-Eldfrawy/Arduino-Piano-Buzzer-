Arduino-Piano-Buzzer
=====================

Description:
============
•	The “ ARDUINO Piano Buzzer ” is a simple simulation for the piano buzzer done by using Arduino Uno.

•	Material Used 
o	Arduino U	no board
o	Breadboard
o	Pencils
o	A4 paper
o	Resistors
o	Speaker

•	Pencils and the A4 paper are used to draw the piano keys which will be wired to the Arduino wires
working as a Capacitive Sensor.

•	Every key will ask the Ardunio to play a specific tone and the sound will be heard from the speakers.

Mechanism OF Capacitive Senor:  
=============================
•	When the send pin changes state, it will eventually change the state of the receive pin. The delay 
between the send pin changing and the receive pin changing is determined by an RC time constant, defined
by R * C, where R is the value of the resistor and C is the capacitance at the receive pin , So when we 
touch the piano’s buttons we increase the capacitance (C), And detect the shifted value which means that
this button was touched.
